Keep your customers
#spot behavioural patterns in historical customer data
Train a ml model using classifciation algorithms to predict customer risk of churning
Applying ml to customer data help companies developed focused customer retention programs
Use streamlit-Our application framework to build Ui components
use docker to build model as endpoint


Leaky bucket theory -
poor marketing,bad advertising 

 Churn rate = total customer lost/total  number of customer


 educate videos ,freee training webinar and increase demos and offer them regular trends in products  


 now we have to look in patterns how to increase data driven business


 Building ml model
 Logistic Regression 
 using sckit learn
 tuning and hyperparameter
